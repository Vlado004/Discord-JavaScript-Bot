# Discord-JavaScript-Bot
A Discord bot made in Javascript using Discord.io and mySQL.

Here is all the code (except important id's) wihout the database tables in the background (still need to figure out how to add those)
JSBot.js is the main file with all the includes, connects etc. This is the file you run
functions.js is where all the functions (duh) are located which simplify discord.io-s functions
blackjack.js and slots.js are mini games connected to the main file

There is another file called info.js which consists of

  module.exports = {

  Discord_Token : "",

  }
  
Where the "" indicated the place for your Token.
